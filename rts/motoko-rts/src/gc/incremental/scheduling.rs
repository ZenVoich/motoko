//! Heuristics for GC scheduling.
//! Tuned for 64-bit main memory with unknown IC memory capacity.
//!
//! Distinction of three scheduling modes:
//! * Critical: The heap exceeds 80% of the memory capacity (using capacity probing):
//!   - Schedule a GC start with a frequency of 1% of the heap growth.
//! * Medium: The heap exceeds 50% of the memory capacity:
//!   - Schedule a GC start with a frequency of 35% of the heap growth.
//! * Low: The heap is below 50% of the memory capacity.
//!   - Schedule a GC start with a frequency of 65% of the heap growth.
//!
//! A heuristics for capacity probing is used to determine the minimum amount of memory capacity.
//! This is necessary because the IC does not provide runtime information about the implemented
//! Wasm memory capacity in 64-bit. This capacity may also increase over time with newer IC versions.
