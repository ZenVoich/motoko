//! Graph-copy-based stabilzation on upgrades, serializing the entire stable object graph into
//! stable memory by using a defined long-term stable storage format.
//!
//! This is to support potentially radical changes of the persistent main memory layout, e.g.
//! introducing a new GC or rearranging persistent metadata. This also relies on precise value
//! tagging to allow more advanced changes that require value metadata, e.g. specializing arrays for
//! small element types or even downgrading to 32-bit heap layouts (provided that the amount of live
//! data fits into a 32-bit memory).
//!
//! A memory compatibility check similar to enhanced orthogonal persistence has to be performed.
//! For this purpose, the type table of the serialized object graph is also stored in stable memory
//! and on upgrade, compared to the new program version.
//!
//! A versioned stable storage format even permits future evolutions of the graph copy algorithm.
//!  
//! See `GraphCopyStabilization.md` for the stable format specification and the employed algorithm.
