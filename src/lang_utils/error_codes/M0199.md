# M0199

This error or warning means that your code is either directly or indirectly using the now deprecated library `ExperimentalStableMemory.mo` (or its supporting compiler primitives).

The library works as advertised but is a potential hazard as the resource it provides access to is shared between all clients of the library.
This means that a library may unintentionally or maliciously read or modify data maintained by your application, or by another library imported by your application.

If possible, please upgrade your code to use library `Region.mo` instead.
This improved library offers a similar abstraction, but instead of a single memory that is implicitly accessible to all callers, it provides multiple memories.
These memories, called regions, are isolated from each other and inaccessible unless a region is explicitly shared between libraries.

The `moc` compiler flag `--experimental-stable-memory <n>` flag controls the production of this error or warning message, allowing your code to compile as before:
* n < 0: error on use of stable memory primitives.
* n = 0: warn on use of stable memory primitives (the default).
* n > 1: warning-less use of stable memory primitives (for legacy applications).

I.e. if your application cannot easily be upgraded to use `Regions.mo` and still requires access to `ExperimentalStableMemory.mo`, you can opt-in to legacy support for `ExperimentalStableMemory.mo` using the `moc` compiler flag `--experimental-stable-memory 1`.
