# M0199

This error indicates that you are trying to use a custom Rust function
which doesn't exist in the Motoko runtime system (RTS).

Example:
```motoko
func my_func() : Nat = (prim "rts:my_func" : () -> Nat)();

let n = my_func(); // 
```

To fix this issue, please check your `MOC_*_RTS` environment variables to ensure
that you are correctly using a custom RTS module.

If you are building a custom RTS, please double-check that the Wasm file contains a
`rts:custom-functions` custom section with function names delimited by semicolons.

Using the [`wasm-custom-section`](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-custom-section) command:
```bash
wasm-custom-section rts/mo-rts.wasm list # List all custom sections
wasm-custom-section rts/mo-rts.wasm show 'rts:custom-functions' # Show the contents of the custom section
```
