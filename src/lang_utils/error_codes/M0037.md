# M0037

If you get this error then you are trying to message from a
block or expression that has no send capability, such as the
top level of an `actor`.

You can also get this error when you are trying to message or
`throw` an error from the `finally` clause of a `try` block.

`finally` clauses are generally used to clean up local state
in the event of messaging failures, and are especially invoked when
the processing of an `await` result traps. In this last-resort cleanup
only local manipulations are allowed to (e.g.) release locks and thus
prevent the canister from ending up in a stuck state.

Should you encounter this error, so make sure that you move all messaging
code out of the `finally` block. In all other cases where send capability
is available, wrapping the indicated expression in an `async` can help.
