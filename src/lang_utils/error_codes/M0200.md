# M0200

If you get this error then you are trying to message from
the `finally` clause of a `try` block.

`finally` clauses are generally used to clean up local state
in the event of messaging failures, and are especially invoked when
the code doing the result processing traps. In this last-resort cleanup
only local manipulations are allowed to (e.g.) release locks and thus
prevent the canister from ending up in a stuck state.

Should you encounter this error, so make sure that you move all messaging
code out of the `finally` block.
