# M0194

This warning means that you defined an identifier without
referencing it later, a good indicator of dead code.

Dubious code example:

```motoko
let nickname = "klutz";
// code that never uses `nickname`
```

If you encounter this warning, you can either delete the definition (if the code has no other side-effect),

```motoko
// code that never uses `nickname`
```

replace it by a wildcard pattern:

```motoko
let _ = "klutz";
// code that never uses `nickname`
```

or just prefix the identifier with an underscore:

```motoko
let _nickname = "klutz";
// code that never uses `nickname`
```
